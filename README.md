Done-List
=========

Done List iOS app created from Framework7 example (JavaScript / HTML5)

#What is it?

Done list is my first attempt to create an all-JavaScript / HTML5 iOS app using Framework7 ( http://www.idangero.us/framework7/ ) to create a native iOS experience with an all-JavaScript webapp.

#Demo

#Installation

After browsing to the demo in Safari, you can click the share button (Third button from the left at the top, near the address bar) and "Add to Home Screen" to create an app-launcher for the webapp.

All files are stored in localstorage and the Safari AppCache, so the app works offline and stores your "Accomplishments" locally. Updates are downloaded automatically (See code).
